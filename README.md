# Problem Statement
Create an AI, ML & Chatbot powered interactive mascot (Chacha Chaudhary) and 
digital avatar to raise awareness and disseminate information about the Namami 
Gange Programme to school children, the common man, and all stakeholders of 
NMCG. 
- The digital avatar/mascot should be able to interact with people of all ages and 
backgrounds. 
- It will be deployed at the entrance of the River Basin War Room & Ganga Museum, as 
well as on the NMCG website. 
- The goal of the project is to create a fun and engaging way for people to learn about 
the Namami Gange Programme and the importance of river conservation.
