The Himalayas are the source of three major Indian rivers namely the Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra, 
Ganga drains a basin of extraordinary variation in altitude, climate, land use, flora & fauna, social and cultural life, 
Ganga has been a cradle of human civilization since time immemorial, 
Millions depend on this great river for physical and spiritual sustenance,

Ganga basin is the largest of the 12 major river basins of India, The river Ganga passes 
through the states of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, and West Bengal, Ganga 
has many tributaries, Even though the surface water resource potential of Ganga has been 
assessed as 525 billion cubic meters (BCM), substantial abstraction of water for various 
purposes from the river has impacted the quantity of flows in the river. 
STATUS OF WATER QUALITY, Rapidly increasing population, rising standards of living and exponential growth of 
industrialization and urbanisation have exposed the river to various forms of degradation, The 
dominant source of pollution is the discharge of untreated wastewater from the towns on the 
banks of Ganga, Thus the water quality of Ganga river is fit for bathing (Class B) except a few locations 
only, which have already been identified and corrective actions by sanctioning projects have 
been taken by NMCG. 
National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), a society registered under the Societies 
Registration Act, 1860 (21 of 1860), is an authority constituted under the River Ganga 
(Rejuvenation, Protection and Management) Authorities Order, 2016 of Govt of India, NMCG

abatement of pollution and rejuvenation, protection and management of the River Ganga and 
its tributaries, It is an empowered arrangement with two tier management having 
administrative, appraisal and approval powers and duties, functions and powers for the purpose 
of effective abatement of pollution and rejuvenation, protection and management of the River Ganga. 
An Integrated Ganga Conservation Mission namely “Namami Gange” has been set up, 
While it seeks to ensure that ultimately in the long term there is an integrated and 
comprehensive plan of collection, conveyance and treatment of wastewater in the towns 
covering both the point and non-point sources of pollution, in the immediate term its objective 
would be to ensure that the quality of Ganga is improved so that it can be put to its best 
designated - use bathing, A list of 118 important towns, which contribute to the pollution 
of the Ganga, has been prepared by NMCG, Important drains that carry the wastewater from 
these towns to the Ganga have been also been identified. 
NATIONAL MISSION FOR CLEAN GANGA (NMCG), 
It has been established as a registered society that is responsible for effective 
implementation of the overall NGRBA program at the national level with well-defined

the permanent entity responsible for the conservation and health of the river Ganga in the long 
term, The Program Management Group (PMG) is headed by the Director General. 
State Program Management Group (SPMG), 
Each state has a State (SGRCA) Program Management Group (SPMG) as a registered 
society, to ensure effective implementation at state level with the exception of Jharkhand, 
which has a dedicated cell within the UD Department, as a very small stretch of the Ganga 
main stem passes through the state, The SPMGs are the respective state level counterparts of the PMG and have state level 
responsibilities for management and implementation of the NGRBA Program in accordance 
with the agreed NGRBA program framework, The SPMG is headed by a Project Director and includes specialists in basin planning, 
wastewater engineering and management, ecology, environment and social management, 
finance & economics, operations, procurement, knowledge management, IT, communications, 
human resources management, and monitoring and evaluation. 
nmcg's water treatment locations The National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) in India focuses on the cleaning and conservation of the Ganges River, As part of its efforts, NMCG may have various water treatment projects and facilities along the Ganges and its tributaries, 
These projects could be spread across different states through which the Ganges flows. how to reduce water pollution, To reduce water pollution, we can:

- Treat wastewater before releasing it into the environment,
- Use less toxic chemicals in industrial processes and agriculture,
- Reduce fertilizer and pesticide runoff from farms,
- Properly dispose of hazardous waste,
- Educate the public about the importance of water conservation and pollution prevention.
